        "In this fourth week’s event, I learned about the unit introduction to business programming. I can gradually tell I am getting better at understanding this unit as a beginner.\n",
        "In this week’s lecture and workshop, I was intrigued by the error handling part of the lecture because it explained and expanded on the input output model and how a person’s luck with data, such as text from the input method, in a properly formatted manner will lead to errors in the results.\n",
        "The exercises I practiced in the workshop helped me see it, experience it, and understand it through practical, not just theoretical, means.\n",
        "In this week's lecture and workshop, I was interested in how I can use simple math and input it in python to get accurate results. The use of different operators, such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.\n",
        "By using Python for mathematical computations, I not only improved my programming skills but also gained a better understanding of the role of mathematics in computer science. Through trial and error and exploration, I discovered the symbiotic relationship between mathematics and programming, noting how understanding one improves skill in the other. This week's lecture and workshop acted as an introduction toward gaining more of Python's capabilities.\n",

        "This week, I studied testing. This builds on the language I introduced last week and adds even more libraries. I examined testing from both the developer's and the user's point of view. I now know the difference between testing and debugging, as well as why it's necessary and why it's done, thanks to this lecture and module. I found out and learned that there are various debugging techniques that may be applied in various situations, such Apply Trial and Error, compare to similar code, Use an IDE, ask for assistance (from peers, forums, or Google), or copy & paste working code. I was able to comprehend this week's workshop and lecture on the relationship between failure and comprehension.\n",

        "I have gained a great deal of personal growth and knowledge from my participation in the Introduction to Programming course. I went into the training feeling a little nervous and curious because I hadn't done much coding before. But every week provided fresh perspectives and difficulties that over time turned my fear into confidence and excitement for programming. I had very little experience with coding beyond HTML when I started the course in the first week. At first, I was apprehensive about learning a new programming language like Python, but the knowledge that the course was intended for novices like me gave me the confidence boost I desperately needed. Despite my initial concerns about coming across difficult arithmetic calculations, I was pleasantly pleased by how simple the core ideas of computer language and data storage, including decimal and binary numbers, were to understand.\n",
        "I was introduced to Python programming and a new approach to problem-solving during the second week. It was enlightening to discover how to deconstruct complicated issues into smaller, more achievable ones, and Python's clarity and ease of use made it unexpectedly approachable, especially for those without any prior coding knowledge. This gained knowledge dispelled my misconception that Python is only for programmers, showing that even novices like myself can benefit from learning it.\n",
        "Due to the interesting lectures and workshops that helped me get a deeper understanding of Python's functions, modules, and keywords, by the third week, my confidence in programming had substantially increased. I gained a thorough grasp of Python's usefulness in programming by learning about various coding formats and their functions in writing code.
